Listening to music and something very personal, I see thousands of people going to the gym with their headphones, people running in the street listening to music.

The music is in **all** places. These people don't just want to appear stylish, or just if they do, they just know that music makes training significantly better!

I'm suspicious to speak because I love music, I was inserted in this world of music very early, I've played the guitar for years and my dream has always been to have a band, and that saying of [Attekita](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCetRsdZxDQDcgVDJd6erz6g).

But let's get down to business...

Programming is an exercise of the mind, it involves extreme attention to detail and a lot of critical thinking. Listening to music can help a lot, with its ability to **motivate**, **increase productivity** and \*\*relax the mind, is the perfect companion for programming.

Everyone has their own personal musical style, I am particularly eclectic, I literally listen to **everything**. I have no prejudice with current music styles. But when I'm working I like to listen to these styles of music:

### üîá Without vocal

When I'm 100% focused on an activity, a bug too big to solve, I like to listen to the songs in [lofi style](<https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_(g%C3%AAnero_musical)>). And a style that adapts well to any situation that involves a lot of concentration at work because the music will just disappear in the background.

### üì¢ Common songs (with vocal)

Good if I am listening to a song that is new to me, I tend to focus more on the music and lyrics, if I listen to the most common songs, which I usually listen to daily my brain can separate the music from the encoding. A song that I am addicted to at the moment: [Imagination ft. (Shiloh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9xdUc1IVik&list=LL&index=107&ab_channel=AstralVibes)

### ‚õ±Ô∏è Classics

This style of music particularly and the ones that motivate me the most, I love to listen to classical music, especially those that have a lot of piano, one that I hear a lot: [Piano Solo: Chopin, Debussy, Liszt, Mozart, Beethoven...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJL_mVgT0Ao&ab_channel=HALIDONMUSIC)

When you are programming by yourself, I will leave here 10 songs for you to be inspired and programmed.

But remember: there are no rules here. Musical tastes vary. But this is one of the great things about programming, we are all inspired by **different aspects of life** to start learning. Take a test and listen to as many different songs as you can, so you'll have a lot of baggage to solve any code problem you have in the future.

And what do you like to listen to as you program?

I'm on twitter in case you want to give me an "HELLO LORES" [@lorenaporphirio](https://twitter.com/lorenaporphirio).

Thanks!
