### January/February

In January I had decided this year to create and improve my portfolio. I always like to expose my work.

In January had my list with my objectives I did in 2019 but there is an item is expose my work regardless of form. For me the solution : Shared things of IT in my instagram ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

But the year was just beginning, and during the year a lot has happened and one of those things I have created this blog (I talk about shortly) but I did some posts in my personal IG for tests, I had the support a lot of people in communites PTBR. One of those people was [Attekita Dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCetRsdZxDQDcgVDJd6erz6g).

I had just started, had very motived but becouse Personal reasons I blocked my instagram and think, how I show my work?

**Spoiler my goals 2021: Return with instagram**

### March

The instagram brought a lot of new people, but I stopped show my work in IG, because I want to bring more extensive content. How: [React or Vue which one should I choose for my project?](https://lorenakauane.com.br/blog/en/2020-09-08-react-or-vue-which-one-should-i-choose-for-my-project/)

In instagram is impossible, but I decided create my blog.

Blog in Construction ....

**Creating this blog made me want to be more and I found that I can be more!**

In May I designed all the screens, decided the fonts, colors, how serious each post card is hahah, learned a lot in the process of UX UI, color composition among many other things to create a project from scratch and alone.

I decided on the technologies I would use, react with gatsbyjs and a few more libs hahaha, as I didn't know how to work with gatsby I decided to invest some money in knowledge and bought the Gatsby course: Create a PWA site with React, GraphQL and Netlify CMS by Willian Justen. It helped me a lot in the process of creating this blog!

In early May my Blog was actually launched in production. I already had 3 triggered posts that I wrote while developing my blog.

- [A verdade sobre GatsbyJs](https://lorenakauane.com.br/blog/pt/2020-04-30-a-verdade-sobre-gatsbyjs/)
- [Maneira mais rÃ¡pida de validar sua ideia - Startup Weekend e Hackatho](https://lorenakauane.com.br/blog/pt/2020-05-01-maneira-mais-rapida-de-validar-sua-ideia-startup-weekend-e-hackathon/)

### June/July

In July I finally finished a project that I dedicated myself with much love and care to Urbla!

**Spoiler goal 2021: Putting the Urbla into production.**

### August

It was the month that I slowed down a little, because of the pandemic's peak, I was unmotivated and I felt weird all the time, I got away from a lot of people. And I really felt alone for a while. But who didn't feel alone with all this happening in the world, right?

Working on side projects no longer made so much sense to me. My blog was not going so well. I ended up leaving Urbla aside.

### November/December

In November I started to study more about products and project creation (at the business level)! I started to think more about the long / medium term for my future.

**Spoiler goal 2021: Focus on learning about sales, digital products and understanding how the internet works and giving my blog and personal marketing a much bigger boost.**

### Damn what year!

It was a very productive year. I learned to focus on things I really like and with each passing day I'm more sure that I love working with technology!

I approached some friends, watched many series, played some games in the video game and went back to playing cs with some friends.

### Expectations and targets for 2021

I already made my list of goals for 2021, as you read, there are some spoilers of what I want for next year! And seriously if you guys knew the list would haha fall back to what is coming.

It will be a very challenging year, studying things that are out of my daily life, but that's the only way for us to keep moving! Never stop, always grow and look for the best for you, until you find yourself. That was the way it's been working for me. Try, make mistakes, learn and redo.

And that's it guys even 2021!
