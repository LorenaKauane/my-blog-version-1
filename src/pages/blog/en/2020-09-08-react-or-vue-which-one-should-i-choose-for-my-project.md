What's up ,

Before going to the subject of the post ...

It's been a while, I know I'm sorry! I added some features on the blog, such as English language support and some CSS changes and I am coming back with the project of the urbla!

I didn't know what to write and I did a search there on my instagram to find out what people want to know. I had several suggestions and one of those suggestions was that of today's post!

Let's talk about these beautiful frameworks?

When we start a new project, each programmer has a different way of dealing with **which stack should I choose for my front end?** React or Vue?

These frameworks have different particularities, and precisely that particularity makes a **difference**. However, these two Frameworks are for solving a problem, and we need to identify how efficient it is.

### Popularity

But before choosing which framework is ideal for your project, you should also consider understanding the market around these technologies (of course if your focus is the job market).

The results of the [StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies) survey are: 35.9% for React, while Vue has 17.3% of the 'votes'.

But that does not mean that React is the most efficient, here we are dealing with popularity, even because Vue has more stars on GitHub

### Rendering

Modern architecture today uses two types of page rendering: the client side (the page is rendered using the resources of the end user's PC) and the server side.

DOM - With it you can access and change the content, layout and even structure of the document. Each framework has its own way of dealing with the DOM, which influences the rendering of the final page.

Vue and React they clone the DOM, they process the copy and compare the result with the source. Then, in the resulting document (the one on the user's screen) they replace only the parts that differ from the processed results. This significantly speeds up the page loading and rendering time, while reducing the amount of traffic used. This can be crucial for mobile users.

### Component architecture

At this point React cannot be called a pure structure, because it is a modified library tailored to the MVC standard (Model-View-Controller, where the Model is responsible for providing the data, View displays the Model data for the user and the Controller interpret the user's actions and cause the model to provide changes and updates.)

Vue can be called pure and complete frameworks.

If your project is based on React, it means that you:

- You will need to research and implement additional libraries for each resource;
- Adjust resources according to the specific library;

Therefore, it will take longer to implement an architecture.

If you use ready-made structures like Vue, there will be no problem in selecting and customizing libraries for different purposes. The high-level API provides backward compatibility for ** all ** libraries. This allows other developers to join the project without researching the architecture.

### Backward compatibility

Every developer knows the importance of updating the architecture, adding new modules and libraries.

- React is a lib with full backward compatibility. You can add different versions of the libraries to your web app and update the old ones with the inheritance of the property.
- Vue is a progressive structure (according to the founder of [Vue Evan You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2P3z7p_zTI&ab_channel=VueNYC) ).

> Its modular system is similar to React, but it also includes all the properties of JS frameworks working with backward compatibility

### React

React support is a bit complicated however we have a **huge community** and that includes developers and **companies** from around the **world** . With this you can find solutions in Russian, Chinese and English etc.

React support is a bit complicated however we have a **huge community** and that includes developers and **companies** from around the **world** . With this you can find solutions in Russian, Chinese and English etc.

The main disadvantage of React is that open source libraries appear daily. It can be a huge difficulty to find documentation that contains all the information about implementation, functions and properties.

### Vue

The Vue community is quite small (although it is more popular on GitHub), especially compared to React. Even our beloved JQuery is used more than Vue.

Typically, you may have to wait for an answer on how to implement a feature. And sometimes there is no answer.

### Conclusion

It is really difficult to decide which technology to choose, but listed the facts above it is up to you to decide which will be your choice based on the most attractive to you in what you want **today** and in the **future**!

Good luck and even more !!!
